# mcsapi-compositor

A Smithay Wayland compositor host for mcsapi desktops. It owns the display,
the Wayland socket, rendering and input; a desktop shell plugs in through the
`Shell` trait and decides placements, shortcuts, title-bar behavior, and
paints its wallpaper, decorations and chrome with egui.

Windows come from two places, and get the same decorations, tiling and focus:

- **Wayland clients** connecting to the socket (asked to use server-side
  decorations through xdg-decoration).
- **In-process apps**: `mcsapi_ui::App`s registered with `mcsapi-runtime`,
  provided through the `Apps` trait (for example the derisk core apps).

Supported today: xdg-shell toplevels and popups, xdg-decoration, wl_shm,
seat (keyboard and pointer), data device (clipboard), wl_output/xdg-output.
The session runs nested in a window of the current X11 or Wayland session
(Smithay's winit backend, GLES renderer, egui painted with `egui_glow`).

Not yet: a DRM/KMS + libinput backend for running on a bare TTY,
layer-shell, XWayland, popup grabs, linux-dmabuf.

## Try it

```console
$ cargo run -p mcsapi-compositor --example tiling -- foot clock
```

`clock` is a built-in in-process app; anything else is spawned with
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` set to the session. Super+Enter opens foot, Super+C the
clock, Super+J/K move focus, Super+Space promotes, Super+1…4 switch
workspaces, Super+Q closes, Super+Escape quits.

## Using it

Implement `Shell` (only window bookkeeping and `placements` are required),
optionally an `Apps` provider, then:

```rust,ignore
let mut compositor = Compositor::new(shell).apps(apps).size(1600, 900);
let remote = compositor.remote(); // run jobs on the shell from other threads
compositor.launch("foot").run()?;
```

Building needs `libxkbcommon-dev`. Running needs EGL/GLES drivers (Mesa's
llvmpipe works, also under Xvfb).
