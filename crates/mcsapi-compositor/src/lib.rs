//! A Smithay Wayland compositor host for mcsapi desktops.
//!
//! The host owns the display, the Wayland socket, rendering and input. A
//! desktop shell plugs in through [`Shell`]: it decides where windows go
//! ([`Shell::placements`]), what keys and title-bar clicks do, and paints
//! its own wallpaper, decorations and chrome with egui. Windows come from two
//! places:
//!
//! - **Wayland clients** (foot, GTK, Qt, ...) connecting to the socket. They
//!   are asked to use server-side decorations.
//! - **In-process apps** registered with [`mcsapi_runtime`] and drawn with
//!   [`mcsapi_ui::App`], through an [`Apps`] provider. They get the same
//!   title bars, tiling and focus as Wayland clients.
//! - **Runtime clients** ([`RuntimeClient`]): programs the compositor starts
//!   itself on a private connection, usually GPUI apps. Because the
//!   compositor made the connection, it trusts the [`Role`] it gave them, so
//!   a GPUI window can be a panel or a full-screen overlay without a
//!   layer-shell protocol (which GPUI does not speak).
//!
//! Each frame paints the wallpaper, then for every window from bottom to top
//! its decoration and its content, then blurs the areas under translucent
//! panels ([`Shell::blur_regions`]), then the chrome. Frames come every
//! [`Shell::frame_interval`], by default once per refresh of the monitor the
//! session window is on. The session runs nested in a window of the current
//! X11 or Wayland session (Smithay's winit backend), or, with the `kms`
//! feature, on the bare seat: DRM/KMS output, libinput input and seat access
//! through libseat. The bare seat is picked when there is no session to nest
//! in, or with `MCSAPI_BACKEND=kms`; `MCSAPI_BACKEND=winit` forces nesting.
